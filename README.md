# LLM Gopher

This is a small library that acts as an adapter to different LLM endpoints.

It doesn't provide any big framework capabilities - it is simply meant as an easy way to create a router for different models.

It is partially inspired by the (LiteLLM Python SDK)[https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm].

## Client types supported

- OpenAI
